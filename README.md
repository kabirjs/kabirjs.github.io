## UCSB Data Science Capstone
[**Project Overview:**] The goal of this project is to digitize Inogen’s comprehensive patient database of medical forms. We are utilizing two distinct implementations of **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** tools – a commercial software tool and custom scripting in **Tesseract**, an open-source **Python** package that utilizes Google’s OCR system. Independently of text extraction, additional data manipulation is necessary to render text content in analysis-ready form. Our primary objective for this project is to automate the extraction of key patient information from prescription forms and render this data in analysis-ready form. We are using mock patient forms to develop an automated pipeline and aim to provide Inogen with an approach and/or program that can be implemented at scale with real patient records.

Overall, our team was able to attain an accuracy of about 80% on handwritten prescription forms. Additionally, we were able to create a dashboard which included forecasts, data visualizations, and automated flagging of the misuse of oxygen concentrators.
